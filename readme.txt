Partial implementation of a Math Tutor Educational application. The goal of this software is to help students learn the concepts of elementary algebra, and basic problem solving.

The software will provide some of the following key features:

-	Implements 4 topics, each with 4-5 levels of competency. Topic 1 covers elementary algebra 
	and arithmetic operations, topic 2 involves evaluating equations and basic problem 
	solving, topic 3 binary arithmetic operations and topic 4 trigonometry.
	
-	To move from one level to another a student has to achieve a certain score.

-	Each level consist of two parts practice and evaluation quiz.

-	The quiz question should be randomly chosen from a pool of questions

-	MathTutor should have built-in recording and assessment functions so the student 
	can track his/her progress. 

-	The software should implement the reporting module which analyses student score to 
	show which areas he/she excels in or needs to work on. 
	
-	Each successful level is followed by a song and words of commendation in order to 
	motivate the student.
	
-	The software should implement the login system with different levels of privileges 
	for three types of users (students, instructors and system administrators).  Instructors 
	should be allowed to add and modify the quiz questions and answers and preview students’ 
	records. Administrators should have the highest level privileges including setting up new 
	accounts for instructors.
